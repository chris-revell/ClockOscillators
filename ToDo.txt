- Can the internal clocks of each of the agents be disrupted/ misaligned with respect to each other? I was thinking of your slider toy here, perhaps model the consequences of one of the agents being the dominant time setter? 

- Can the speed of the attracting diffusion gradient expansion be increased and decreased? In the model are the agents responding to the signal depending on their own internal clock, that is to say, more likely to migrate depending on their phase? 

- Can the "field of influence" of the agents on the phases of other agents be shown around each agent?  similar to the diffusible "wound" signal in the centre? 

- It seems that immune cells move at different speeds depending on their phase. Is that a possible parameter to model with these agents? This speed immune cell speed phenomenon is based on published data and matches what I'm seeing in my own experiments.
